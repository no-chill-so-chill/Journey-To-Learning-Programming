# Journey-To-Learning-Programming
This is a repository were I will upload activities and documents I encounter in my programming journey

This will be dedicated to sharing my activities (this includes homework) and documents I come across that I happen to find very helpful in my journey to learning to become a programmer. If this helps you feel free to use this repository! Thank you for your time!  


P.S. this is my first repository!
